## Goals
Design and implement a simple item system that generates and removes items (weapons, armor, consumables, etc.) from a gameplay instance. This system will be extended into a full inventory system that can be associated with the player character, "stash," and environment.

## TODO
* Find way to require that an item goes in a given slot. Possibly enumerated types inside of terminal class definition.
